# 2.Suppose you have two sets of employee dataâ€”one containing information about full-time employees
# and another containing information about part-time employees. You want to combine this data to create a comprehensive employee dataset for HR analysis.

# Combine the datasets using np.vstack: This function vertically stacks the two arrays, effectively combining them into one.
